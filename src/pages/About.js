          About
        <p>An accounting application is a software program that captures and records all accounting transactions. It often divides functions into modules such as accounts payable, accounts receivable, inventory, and more. An accounting application may run on a locally managed set of hardware and networking equipment or rely on the expertise of a third-party-managed cloud-based infrastructure.</p>
